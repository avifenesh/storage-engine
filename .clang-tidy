# Clang-Tidy configuration for storage-engine-kernel
# This is a Linux kernel-style project, so we disable checks for C11 secure functions
# that are not available on Linux systems.
Checks: 'clang-diagnostic-*,clang-analyzer-*,-clang-analyzer-security.insecureAPI.DeprecatedOrUnsafeBufferHandling'

# Explanation:
# - The C11 "secure" functions like memset_s, fprintf_s are not available on Linux
# - Our code uses memset/fprintf with proper bounds checking (sizeof, explicit size calculations)
# - This is standard practice in kernel and systems programming
# - These warnings are overly strict for our use case
