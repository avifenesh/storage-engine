/**
 * @file bucket.h
 * @brief Public API for bucket state management in open addressing.
 *
 * Overview:
 * - Provides predicates and state-modification functions for the three bucket
 *   states used in the hash engine's linear probing scheme.
 *
 * Bucket States (Encoding):
 * - Empty (never written): key == NULL && key_len == 0
 * - Tombstone (deleted): key == NULL && key_len != 0
 * - Active (valid entry): key != NULL
 *
 * Usage in Hash Engine:
 * - hash_put(): Uses bucket_is_empty() to locate insertion point; tracks
 *   first bucket_is_tombstone() for potential reuse.
 * - hash_get(): Probes past tombstones (bucket_is_tombstone()), stops at
 *   bucket_is_empty().
 * - hash_delete(): Converts active bucket to tombstone via
 *   bucket_make_tombstone().
 * - hash_engine_resize(): Skips tombstones during rehash; only copies active
 *   entries to new table.
 *
 * Design Rationale:
 * - State is encoded in existing fields (key pointer and key_len) to avoid
 *   adding a separate flag byte.
 * - Functions are simple and suitable for inlining or integration into caller
 *   loops.

 * Notes:
 * - Tombstones allow linear probing to continue past deleted slots.

 * - Does not free any caller-owned memory.
