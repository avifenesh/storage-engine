/**
 * @file hash_engine.h
 * @brief Public API for a SipHash-based hash table with linear probing.
 *
 * Overview:
 * - Provides dynamic key/value storage using a bucket array with linear probing
 *   for collision resolution and tombstones for correct deletion semantics.
 * - Bucket array grows/shrinks based on load factor thresholds to maintain
 *   O(1) average-case operations.
 * - Uses SipHash-2-4 with per-process random keys to hash keys to bucket
 *   indices.
 * - Stores raw key/value pointers (caller-owned); no deep copying.
 *
 * Collision Resolution:
 * - Linear probing: on collision, probe the next bucket (wrapping at array
 *   end).
 * - Tombstones: deleted entries are marked (key == NULL, key_len != 0) to
 *   allow probe chains to continue past deleted slots.
 * - Resize/rehash: moves all active entries to a new array; tombstones are
 *   discarded.
 *
 * Thread-safety:
 * - All public API functions are synchronized with an internal mutex.
 * - Concurrent calls to the same engine are safe; operations are serialized.
 *
 * Ownership and lifetime:
 * - Keys and values are not copied; only pointers and lengths are stored.
 *   Callers must ensure memory remains valid until deletion or engine
 *   destruction.
 *
 * Error handling:
 * - Functions return 0 on success; negative (usually -1) on failure.
 * - Not found conditions (hash_get, hash_delete) return negative values.
 *
 * Load Factor Tuning:
 * - Resize occurs when load factor > MAX_LOAD_FACTOR (0.75) or
 *   < MIN_LOAD_FACTOR (0.2).
 * - Bucket count bounds: MIN_BUCKET_COUNT (16) to MAX_BUCKET_COUNT
 *   (1048576).
