# Sprint 6: Columnar Layout and Encoding

Goal: Implement column groups (PAX), zone maps, and basic encodings (dict/RLE/bitpack).

Acceptance:
- Encoders/decoders documented and tested; mixed encodings supported.
- Zone maps pruned in scans; measurable benefit demonstrated.
- Benchmarks on encoded vs plain scans with p50/p99.
