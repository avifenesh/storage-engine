# Sprint 7: Vectorized Executor

Goal: Implement data chunks, selection vectors, and vectorized scan/filter/project.

Acceptance:
- Stable chunk size; selection vector propagation; clear API.
- Measured speedup over tuple‑at‑a‑time; p50/p99 reported.
- Tests for correctness and chunk boundary edge cases.
