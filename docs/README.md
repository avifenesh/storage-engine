# 📚 Kernel-Accelerated Text Search Engine - Documentation

## Project Overview

This is a **focused learning project** for C systems programming, building a kernel-accelerated text search engine. The project has been restructured from an overambitious "multi-modal database" to a realistic, achievable learning path that still maintains technical depth.

**New Focus**: Build a text search engine with kernel acceleration to learn:
- Linux kernel module development
- Text processing algorithms (inverted indexes, TF-IDF)
- ARM NEON SIMD optimization for string operations
- Kernel vs user-space performance trade-offs

## 🎯 Project Goals

### Realistic Scope
- **Target**: Build a functional text search engine that can index 100K documents
- **Performance**: <10ms search latency for simple queries
- **Learning Time**: 3-5 months for a competent C programmer
- **Skills**: Kernel programming, text algorithms, SIMD optimization

### What We're Building
1. **User-space text processor** - Tokenization, inverted index, TF-IDF scoring
2. **Kernel character device** - `/dev/textsearch` with IOCTL interface
3. **SIMD optimizations** - ARM NEON for string operations
4. **Rust client library** - Safe interface to kernel module
5. **Performance analysis** - Benchmarking and optimization guide

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SAFETY WARNINGS

### Kernel Development Risks
- **System Crashes**: Kernel bugs can crash your entire system
- **Data Loss**: Kernel panics may corrupt filesystems
- **Security**: Improper validation can create security vulnerabilities
- **Hardware**: Incorrect drivers can damage hardware (rare but possible)

### Safety Precautions
1. **ALWAYS test in a virtual machine first**
2. **Keep backups of important data**
3. **Never test on production systems**
4. **Use a dedicated development machine if possible**
5. **Enable kernel debugging options**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C Programming**: Solid understanding of pointers, memory management, structs
- **Linux Knowledge**: 
  - Command line proficiency
  - Understanding of file systems and permissions
  - Basic kernel concepts (user/kernel space)
- **Development Environment**:
  - ARM64 Linux system (or VM)
  - GCC 9+ with ARM64 support
  - Linux kernel headers (linux-headers-$(uname -r))
  - Git for version control
  - Make (GNU Make 4.0+)
- **Hardware Requirements**:
  - Minimum 2GB RAM (4GB recommended)
  - 10GB free disk space
  - ARM64 processor (or emulation)

### Recommended Setup
```bash
# Install development tools (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
sudo apt-get install git make gcc gdb valgrind
sudo apt-get install linux-tools-common linux-tools-generic

# Verify ARM64
uname -m  # Should show aarch64

# Verify kernel headers
ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build
```

### Quick Start
1. Complete Sprint 1 if not already done ✅
2. **SET UP A VM FOR KERNEL DEVELOPMENT**
3. Read [sprint-2-text-processing.md](sprints/sprint-2-text-processing.md)
4. Follow the implementation guide in each sprint
5. Use the Makefile for building and testing

## 📝 Note on Scope Change

This project was restructured from an impossible "multi-modal hybrid database" to a focused text search engine. The new scope:
- ✅ Achievable by a single developer
- ✅ Maintains educational value
- ✅ Covers real systems programming skills
- ✅ Has practical applications

See [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for details on the restructure.
