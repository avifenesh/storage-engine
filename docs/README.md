# 📚 Columnar Database Engine — Documentation

## Project Overview

This is a self‑learning project to build a traditional, columnar database with a pragmatic SQL subset (CREATE/INSERT/SELECT/JOIN/GROUP/ORDER), developed incrementally from core storage primitives to a vectorized execution engine. Kernel integration is optional and strictly profile‑gated.

Guiding principles:
- Userspace first (sharding, NUMA, hugepages, SIMD, io_uring); add kernel features only when profiling proves a benefit and safe fallbacks exist.
- Sprints are documentation and measurement guides; solutions are not provided.
- Performance is measured locally, not in CI.

## 🎯 Project Goals

### Realistic Scope
- Target: A functional analytical (columnar) DB with a pragmatic SQL subset
- Performance: Vectorized execution with competitive p50/p99; WAL durability
- Learning: 3–6 months; focus on storage, execution, and optimization

### What We're Building
1. Userspace storage: hash + B+ tree; page/buffer manager; WAL
2. Columnar layout: encoding, zone maps, vectorized scans
3. SQL layer: parser → logical optimizer → executor
4. Performance: SIMD paths, NUMA/hugepages, io_uring I/O
5. Optional kernel work: eBPF/XDP/targeted modules if justified

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SAFETY WARNINGS

### Kernel Development Risks
- **System Crashes**: Kernel bugs can crash your entire system
- **Data Loss**: Kernel panics may corrupt filesystems
- **Security**: Improper validation can create security vulnerabilities
- **Hardware**: Incorrect drivers can damage hardware (rare but possible)

### Safety Precautions
1. **ALWAYS test in a virtual machine first**
2. **Keep backups of important data**
3. **Never test on production systems**
4. **Use a dedicated development machine if possible**
5. **Enable kernel debugging options**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C Programming**: Solid understanding of pointers, memory management, structs
- **Linux Knowledge**: 
  - Command line proficiency
  - Understanding of file systems and permissions
  - Basic kernel concepts (user/kernel space)
- **Development Environment**:
  - ARM64 Linux system (or VM)
  - GCC 9+ with ARM64 support
  - Linux kernel headers (linux-headers-$(uname -r))
  - Git for version control
  - Make (GNU Make 4.0+)
- **Hardware Requirements**:
  - Minimum 2GB RAM (4GB recommended)
  - 10GB free disk space
  - ARM64 processor (or emulation)

### Recommended Setup
Use a VM for kernel experiments; measure performance locally, not in CI. See `MAKEFILE_USAGE_GUIDE.md` for commands.

### Quick Start
1. Complete Sprint 1 if not already done ✅
2. **SET UP A VM FOR KERNEL DEVELOPMENT**
3. Read the sprint guides under docs/sprints/ starting with sprint-2-hash-storage.md
4. Follow the implementation guide in each sprint
5. Use the Makefile for building and testing

## 📈 Learning Path (High Level)

Foundations → Storage → Execution → SQL → Concurrency → Performance & Ops (see Sprint Documentation above for details).

## 🔧 Development Tools

- **Build System**: Comprehensive Makefile with educational features
- **Memory Safety**: AddressSanitizer and Valgrind integration
- **Assembly Analysis**: Educational assembly generation
- **Performance Tools**: Built-in benchmarking support

## 📝 Notes

Sprints guide learning and measurements; no code solutions are included. Kernel work is optional and gated by profiling.
